<h1 id="fstab">fstab</h1>
<p>A simple /etc/fstab, using kernel name descriptors:<br />
/etc/fstab<br />
# &lt;file system&gt; &lt;dir&gt; &lt;type&gt; &lt;options&gt; &lt;dump&gt; <pass><br />
/dev/sda1 / ext4 defaults,noatime 0 1<br />
/dev/sda2 none swap defaults 0 0<br />
/dev/sdb /home ext4 defaults,noatime 0 2</p>
<h2 id="field-definitions">Field definitions</h2>
<p>Each line in the /etc/fstab file contains the following fields separated by spaces or tabs:<br />
file_system dir type options dump pass</p>
<h2 id="file-system">file system</h2>
<p>The partition or storage device to be mounted. dir The mountpoint where <file system> is mounted to. ##type The file system type of the partition or storage device to be mounted. Many different file systems are supported: ext2, ext3, ext4, btrfs, reiserfs, xfs, jfs, smbfs, iso9660, vfat, ntfs, swap and auto. The auto type lets the mount command guess what type of file system is used. This is useful for optical media (CD/DVD). ##options Mount options of the filesystem to be used. See the mount man page. Please note that some options are specific to filesystems; to discover them see below in the aforementioned mount man page. ##dump Used by the dump utility to decide when to make a backup. Dump checks the entry and uses the number to decide if a file system should be backed up. Possible entries are 0 and 1. If 0, dump will ignore the file system; if 1, dump will make a backup. Most users will not have dump installed, so they should put 0 for the dump entry. ##pass Used by fsck to decide which order filesystems are to be checked. Possible entries are 0, 1 and 2. The root file system should have the highest priority 1 (unless its type is btrfs, in which case this field should be 0) - all other file systems you want to have checked should have a 2. File systems with a value 0 will not be checked by the fsck utility.</p>
