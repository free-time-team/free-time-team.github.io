<h2 class="chapter">1 Proposal for htc</h2>

<p>My name is Brenton Mark Rossow and I am a Film and Video/ Photomedia student at Edith Cowan University (ECU), Perth Western Australia. I first visited Shanghai in January 2016 with twenty ECU students as part of a study tour organized through University of Shanghai Science and Technology (USST) and I’m currently doing an artist’s residence at USST. During our month long study tour our group held two photography exhibitions in Shanghai in conjunction with USST’s staff and students.
These exhibitions documented life in Shanghai through the eyes of ECU’s Photomedia students and were also exhibited in Perth Western Australia.
</p>
<p>It is my intention to hold two exhibitions in Shanghai in March or April 2017 and a further two exhibitions in Perth Australia in late 2017, early 2018. These exhibitions will be held together with Lianxi Zhang, a mixed media artist and lecturer at USST, and Harrison See, a postgraduate visual arts student from ECU, who is currently doing an artist’s residency in Xiamen, China.
</p>
<p>The work in the exhibition will focus upon the relationships humans have with the natural world. Liangxi Zhang’s video installations are concerned with the impact humans unknowingly have upon insects who must overcome great obstacles to cross the road. Harrison’s paintings reflect upon how people are connected with the landscape. And my work will show the peculiar objects people abandon in the Australian bush, such as televisions, cars, microwaves, and other household items.
</p>
<p>This exhibition intends to strength ties between Australian and Chinese artists. USST and ECU have collaborated artistically for over a decade and supported each other in numerous projects. Our exhibition is a continuation of this close relationship and will present work of the highest standard, which showcases this important intercultural relationship.
</p>
<p>I request assistance from HTC in the development of this project in the form of helping to design a successful virtual reality application that will support this exhibition. The photos of abandoned objects in the Australian bush would greatly benefit from the latest VR technology accompanied by an ambient soundtrack.
</p>
<p>I would like to provide HTC with 84 photographs, an ambient soundtrack, and a music video, which could be adapted to HTC’s VR equipment. This could then be showcased at an exhibition at E-gallery in Shanghai in March or April 2017. It would also be shown at Australia China Arts Foundation’s Shanghai gallery in March or April 2017, and at a further two locations in Australia in late 2017, early 2018.
</p>
<p>We would be proud to have HTC’s support with this project and intent to share this collaboration with the wider community. It would be a good opportunity to showcase HTC’s VR technology in both China and Australia and to strengthen ties between ECU, USST and HTC, and Shanghai’s arts community and general public. We are also open to options as to how this project may be further enhanced and look forward to future discussions.
</p>
<p>Warm regards
Brenton Mark Rossow

Biography
Harrison See is an artist from Perth, who originally came from an industrial design background until
several years ago when he made the decision to shift his focus from manufacturing to the visual arts.
See has experimented with many artistic mediums though predominately identifies himself as a painter,
while occasionally returning to sculpture, drawing on his years of 3D design experience.
See most recently graduated from Edith Cowan University with First Class honours, while also being
presented with The Louise Macfie Painting Prize. He was also awarded one of the prestigious New
Colombo Plan (NCP) Scholarships by the Federal Government of Australia, which allowed him to live
and paint in Shanghai for six months. This scholarship will also fund Harrison See’s return to China in
early 2017 where he will carry out a three-month long artist residency at the Chinese European Art
Centre (CEAC) in Xiamen.
